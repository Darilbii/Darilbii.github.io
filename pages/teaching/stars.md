## What is STARS?
The University of California, San Diego Summer Training Academy for Research Success (STARS) program is an eight-week summer research academy for community college students, undergraduate students, recent college graduates, and masters students. Opened to all disciplines, STARS offers student participants a rigorous research opportunity with esteemed UC San Diego faculty, informative transfer and graduate school preparation workshops, and educational, cultural, and social activities in sunny San Diego.

## What is Great About the Program?

As an alumni of the program I know how transformative it can be. I credit the STARS program for helping me get into graduate school. The GRE training and Fellowships application training I received were a big help while I was preparing to finish my last year of Graduate School. Most importantly the friends and mentors I met through the program have been an excellent support network that has enabled me to navigate the academic world. Being a Graduate Advocate allowed me to pass on some of the knowledge I gained since my participation to the next class of engineering graduate students of color.
