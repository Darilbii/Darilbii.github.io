Authenticity, Compassion, and intimacy.

I earned my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering fully funded at Howard University with the Capstone Scholarship and as a Jackie Robinson Foundation Scholar. Receiving both the NSF GRFP and the UC-HBCU Fellowship I also earned my Masters degree in Bioengineering from UC San Diego. Currently I am a PhD candidate in UCSD’s Electrical Engineering Department.

Growing up with a grandparent who was paraplegic I have always wanted to work in the Neural Engineering space. A passing thought I had as a child, “why couldn’t my grandfather walk?”, became a crucible which influenced my core value of compassion and my academic interests in science, medicine, and engineering. Throughout my career I have worked on several interdisciplinary projects ranging from materials, unmanned vehicles, to brain-machine-interfaces.

As an engineer, I know that to tackle the task of understanding the complicated structure and function of the brain one must work in interdisciplinary teams. For this reason I am dedicated to continuously improving my ability to communicate and collaborate across disciplines. I've been fortunate to take part in several training opportunities across the country. Where I gained experience in engineering leadership, entrepreneurship, collaborative tool building, neural population dynamics and open science. As a aspiring lifelong learner, I plan to continue expanding and  refining these skills for years to come. Ultimately, I hope to help ensure that Neurotechnology will have both a positive and equitable impact on humanity.

The three characteristics at the top of this page are my core values. These values permeate everything that I do and influence my actions when collaborating with or leading teams. I list these values first to be transparent about my motivations, but to also inform potential future collaborators of who I am and what I stand for.
