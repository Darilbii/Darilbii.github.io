As a graduate student at the UC San Diego I had the opportunity to take part in a excellent opportunity to channel my inner Bill Nye to explain my thesis research to the broader public. The rules are simple. Explain your research in under 3 minutes with only three slides in front of a huge crowd. Sounds simple enough right? I thought not.

Although anxiety inducing, my participation in Grad Slam gave me a priceless opportunity to practice my style of science communication and get more comfortable explaining science to the public.
