My name is Daril Brown and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Electrical Engineering Department at UC San Diego specializing in Medical Devices. I work under the advisement of both Prof. Vikash Gilja in the [Translational Neural Engineering Lab](http://tnel.ucsd.edu/) and Prof. Tim Gentner in the [Auditory Neurophysiology Lab](http://gentnerlab.ucsd.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [Voytek Lab](http://www.voyteklab.com). At present my research seeks to establish song birds as a novel animal model for the development of a human speech prosthesis. You can read more about my current research [here](/research).
