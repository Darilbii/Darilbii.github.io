teaser: Hello! My name is Daril Brown II and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Electrical Engineering Department at UC San Diego specializing in Medical Devices. I work under the advisement of both Prof. Vikash Gilja in the Translational Neural Engineering Lab and Prof. Tim Gentner in the auditory neurophysiology lab. I am also affiliated with the Voytek Lab. At present my research seeks to establish song birds as a novel animal model for the development of a human speech prosthesis. You can read more about my current research here.
